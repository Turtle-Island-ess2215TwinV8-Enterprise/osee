		<h1>Delete Query Log</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Deletes all of the recorded queries from the log then refreshes the view. The log has a max capacity and once it is met
		no more entries will be added, so deleting the log will be necessary to see any new queries that are being performed.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		Select the delete button (<img src="../../images/delete_edit.gif"/>) from the toolbar on the top portion of the Query Log view.<br/>
