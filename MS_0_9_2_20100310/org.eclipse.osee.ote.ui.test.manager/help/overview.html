<h1>Test Manager Overview</h1>

<p>
The test manager is the application that is used to run test programs in the OTE (OSEE Test 
Environment).  The Test Manager is in the editor area of Eclipse.  
</p>
<p>
In the OTE, tests are run which are referred to as test scripts.  The Test Manager has multiple 
pages which are used to manage the running of these scripts.  To navigate to each page, the user selects
the associated tab on the bottom of the Test Manager.  The Overview page can be configured
with some basic overview info for the particular configuration that is extending the OTE.  
The Hosts page allows the user to see and connect to test environments that are used in the running
of scripts.  The Scripts page is the page where the scripts are actually run.  The Advanced page
has many configuration options related to the running of scripts.  The Source page is where codes
to run the scripts against can be specified.
