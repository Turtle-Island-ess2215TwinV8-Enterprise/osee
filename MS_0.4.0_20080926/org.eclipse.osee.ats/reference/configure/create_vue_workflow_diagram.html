   <h1>Create new VUE workflow diagram</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		To create a new VUE diagram that ATS uses to move an Action through it's specific workflow.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Diagram must have Endorse and Completed</li>
         <li>Endorse state must have Title, Description, Priority, Deadline, Change Type, Validation</li>
         <li>Each state must have a unique identifier as the state id</li>
         <li>Use "-DAtsUseWorkflowFiles" flag to instruct ATS to use a specified file in the workspace to use (versus a skynet artifact).  This helps speed the development of the workflow.</li>
         <li>If using "-DAtsUseWorkflowFiles" flag, put file path resolution info in AtsWorkFlowFactory.java</li>
      </ul>
