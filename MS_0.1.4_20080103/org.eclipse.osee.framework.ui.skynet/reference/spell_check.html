		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Enable data entered in OSEE to be spell checked.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		As data is entered into OSEE spell-checked fields, a blue line will be displayed if the word is not recognized.
		Only lower-case words or words with only first character uppercase will be spell checked.  Acronyms, words with
		special characters, numbers and single letter words will be ignored.
		<h2>Main Dictionary</h2>
		OSEE has a main dictionary included in it's release.  See below for it's source, copyrights and credits.
		<h2>Additional Released Dictionaries</h2>
		Additionally dictionaries can be added to OSEE via extension points.  These can only be
		modified by hand and thus included in normal release cycle.
		<h2>Run-time Global Dictionary</h2>
		Each OSEE user is able to add words to a Global dictionary stored in the database by right-clicking on the word
		underlined in blue and selecting to save global.  These words are stored in the "Global Preferences" artifact
		and will then be shown as a valid word in all users's spell checking.
		<h2>Run-time Personal Dictionary</h2>
		Each OSEE user is able to add words to their Personal dictionary stored in the database by right-clicking on the word
		underlined in blue and selecting to save personal.  These words are stored in the user's "User" artifact
		and will then be shown as a valid word only for that user.
