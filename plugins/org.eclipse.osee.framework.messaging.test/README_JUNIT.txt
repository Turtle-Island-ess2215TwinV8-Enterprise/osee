The tests in this package require the following bundles to be INSTALLED.

jms.activemq.launch
jms.libraries

They can be checked out from svn then exported and put into the '<eclipse_install>/dropins' folder.

These bundles allow us to easily start and stop a message broker using an eclipse application.  
This is required to run several of our tests.
