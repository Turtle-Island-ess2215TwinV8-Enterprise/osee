	must do Sematic versioning
		meaning of version segments
			major (new API non-compatible - broken compatibility )
			minor (new feature that doesn't break previous API compatibility)
			micro (no visible change like performance improvements, bug fixes)
			qaulifier (no sematic meaning like timestamp)
			[ = inclusive
			( = exclusive
			providers use a narrow version range
			consumers use the wider version range
		wizard to managing version numbers (diffs with previous version)
		@ConsumerType
		@ProviderType
		OSGI Extenders
		requirements and capabilities 
		transformed into a rest endpoint; jaxrs
		bnd tools rt project has a rest bridge
		
		
		coverity scan = find bugs and coverity
		Nexus @ repo.eclipse.org= maven repository for Eclipse bundles 
		
		
making classes final can improve performance 10 times because it enable the JIT to inline methods
		
100 % of ALM investigations discover serious problems that start in requirements


story boards, wire frames, mockups

Monoply money to each key user rep. with actions with prices

requirements provide 3 kinds of info: descriptive, actionable, contextual (what is your real goal, personas),
themes and epics between gap of contextual and actionable

traditional req approach <-> modern approach
order takers <-> business partners
everything must be on the list <-> its ton the list if it provides mutal value
project <-> products
 
 
More than 20,000 running instances of Sonar in the world
Sonar provide differential views (version 3.5)
80% code coverage goal for all new and changed code

pay attention to the minor issues that occur frequently because they can be very frustrating and can be as important as major bugs

do useability testing with think out loud

run 64-bit JVM and change 32-bit default to 64
use concucrrent gc
ensure using server JVM
