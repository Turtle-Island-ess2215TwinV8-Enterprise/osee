<h1>Model Overview</h1>

<p>
Models in the OTE environment are intended to be java objects that 'model' some aspect 
of the test environment needed by the Unit Under Test.  Most likely this will be an  
external device that communicates with the unit under test so that different scenarios 
can be recreated and tested.
</p>
<p>
OTE provides management capabilities for models so that they can be easily accessed from both
Java test programs and GUI's in the testers workbench.
