		<h1>Change Report View</h1>

		<img src="change_report_view.gif"/>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The Change Report View is used to summarize the changes that have been made on a branch or series of transactions.</p>
		<h2>Icons</h2>

		<li><img src="../images/relate.gif"/> Base image for relation links</li>
		<li><img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/molecule.gif"/> Base image for attributes</li>
		<li><img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/inc_new.gif"/> Overlay to mark item as an incoming new item</li>
		<li><img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/inc_change.gif"/> Overlay to mark item as an incoming modification</li>

		<li><img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/con_new.gif"/> Overlay to mark an item as being new but having incoming changes</li>
		<li><img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/con_change.gif"/> Overlay to mark an item as having incoming and outgoing changes</li>

		<h2>Branch Change Report</h2>
		<p>A Change Report can be performed for a branch two ways. The first way is by selecting right-clicking a branch 
		from the Branch Manager then choosing the "Show Change Report" menu item. The second way is to select
		"Show Change Report" from the Aspect view of an ATS Action that is still in work; this will do a Change
		Report for the working branch of the Aspect.</p>
		<p>This type of Change Report will display all of the artifacts on the branch that have had an attribute
		or relation link modified. It will also do conflict detection on these artifacts against the parent branch.
		All changes done on the current artifact will appear with a grey right arrow<img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/out_change.gif"/>, while all changes from the
		parent branch will be shown with a blue left arrow<img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/inc_change.gif"/>. Attributes and relation links with multiple changes will
		provide a summarized node that shows the final effect of the changes and can be expanded to view all of the
		minor changes that were made. If an attribute or relation link was modified on both
		branches then the summary will show a red conflict mark<img src="../../org.eclipse.osee.framework.skynet.core/images/con_change.gif"/> to signify that a commit will cause an override
		to occur.
