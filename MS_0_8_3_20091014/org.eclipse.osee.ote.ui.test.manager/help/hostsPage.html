		<h1>Test Manager Hosts Page</h1>
		<p>The Hosts page of Test Manager shows the test servers that are available for the user to
		connect to.  These test servers are the services that the test scripts code is actually run.&nbsp; Below is a screenshot showing an example of the Hosts tab with a test server available
		to be connected to before the user is connected.  A user can connect a test server from
		this page.&nbsp; This table is an XViewer Table which allows the user to 
		employ column sorting.</p>

		<p>Below is the same example after a user named osee has connected to the test server.
		Notice the lightning bolt in the left column of the server entry in the table and the 
		user's name in the User column.<p>
