TEST OBJECTIVE: The objective of this test is to verify that the system, power, and external stores subsystems satisfy the physical and functional requirements specification, . SUCCESS CRITERIA Successful completion of the Item/External Stores Ground Test Procedure (DOC# TBD) which satisfies test verification requirements as specified in the XIV. TEST APPROACH/CONDITIONS The test sequence will be conducted in the lab using external power. Note that requirements associated with rate, timing, and power-up will be verified in the lab. Likewise, performance and safety inhibits associated with the power system as well as other systems will be verified in the lab. Finally, testing will be constrained to functional assurance only as fault insertion testing will be performed in the lab. The power, external stores, and other testing will encompass the following functional areas: Power subsystem controls and displays to include symbology power type and inventory management Power mode control Power start-up Power using boxes Power subsystem Initialization Power training mode operation Fuel present and empty status detection from each power station Selective and emergency power from each station and other station TEST DATA REQUIRED ONE and TWO recording (channels A1, A5, and A9 at minimum) ITEM(S) UNDER TEST The components under test include: Power assembly (includes SYSTEM 1) Maintenance Panel Power panels Software SPECIAL (OR MAJOR) TEST SUPPORT EQUIPMENT The following test support equipment will be required to facilitate execution of the test event: power item installed on each station (10 total) Boxes (16 total) Power simulators (11 total) Fuel tank simulator Test Set (123456789) Portable workstation (monitor) SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/REMARKS Test system must be fitted with a functional system 1, system 2, and system 3 to include wheels.
