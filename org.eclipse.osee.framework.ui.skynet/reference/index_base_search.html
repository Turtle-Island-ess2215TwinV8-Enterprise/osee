		<h1>Index Based Searching</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		Artifacts in Skynet all go through an indexing process when they are saved. Each attribute is analyzed during this process
		to produce a list of tags that are then associated with the artifact. Index based searching then uses these tags to search
		for the artifacts.
		<h2>How Attributes Become Tags</h2>
		The Skynet System relies on Taggers to produce tags for the attributes of a particular artifact. The TaggerManager 
		supplies the best tagger for an artifact. The tagger then processes all attributes to produce a set of tags. All tags
		are tokenized (separator discarded) on ASCII characters 0-32, 34 ("), and 127 (delete).<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Example:</b> If a tag was <i>"Hello"</i> it would become <i>Hello</i>, and if it was <i>"Hello"World</i> it would become 2 tags, <i>Hello</i> and <i>World</i>.<br/>
		<br/>
		Next, all the tags are split (separators kept) on ASCII characters 33 – 47, 58 – 64, 91 – 96, and 123 – 126( all standard ASCII
		characters that are not in A-Z, a-z, or 0-9).<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Example:</b> If a tag was <i>12+34+56=102</i> it would become 6 tags, <i>12</i>, <i>+</i>, <i>34</i>, <i>56</i>, <i>=</i>, and <i>102</i>.<br/>
		<br/>
		If no specialized tagger is available then the BaseTagger is used. The BaseTagger treats all attributes as plain-text, 
		except for Word Formatted Content which is converted to a plain-text format. Tags are then generated by splitting the text
		on white-space.
