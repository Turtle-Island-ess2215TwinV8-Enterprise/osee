		<h1>Show Change Report</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		A view that shows all of the changes made on a branch, or between two transactions on the same branch.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		<h3>For a branch</h3>
		Use <a href="branch_filtering.html">filtering</a> or sorting to locate the branch of interest. Right-click
		the branch and select <i>Show Change Report</i>. The change report will show all changes made on the branch
		since its baseline.<br/>
		<br/>
		If anything is selected in addition to the one branch, then the <i>Show Change Report</i> menu item will be disabled.
		<h3>For a range of transactions</h3>
		Use <a href="branch_filtering.html">filtering</a> or sorting to locate the branch with the transactions. Then locate the
		starting and ending transactions. Select both of the transactions by ctrl-clicking each transaction, then right-click 
		and select <i>Show Change Report</i>. The change report will show all changes after the earlier transaction, up to and
		including the later transaction.<br/>
		<br/>
		If anything is selected in addition to the two transactions, or the two transactions are on seperate branches,
		the <i>Show Change Report</i> menu item will be disabled.
