		<h1>Deleting Artifacts</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		<p>Artifacts may be deleted from the Artifact Explorer. 
		<br>
		<b>Caution</b> should be taken in performing this task because along with the artifact all of its default hierarchy children will also be deleted.</p>

		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		<p>To delete an artifact and its children select the desired artifact and the right click, next select the “Delete Artifact” menu item. A dialog will be displayed asking for deletion confirmation.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Note:</h2>
		<p>An artifact may also be deleted by selecting an artifact and pressing the delete key.</p>
