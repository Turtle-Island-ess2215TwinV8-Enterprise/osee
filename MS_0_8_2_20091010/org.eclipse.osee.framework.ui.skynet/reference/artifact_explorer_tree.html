		<h1>Drag and Drop</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>Artifacts dragged from the explorer produce different results depending on the application they are dropped onto. While artifacts dropped onto the explorer produce a new Default Hierarchal Relationship with the target artifact as the parent and the source as the child.</p>

		<h2>Dragging An Artifact From The Artifact Explorer</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If an artifact is dragged from the explorer into a Word document a hyper link will be created with the artifact name in text and when selected it will open the artifact in the Artifact Editor.</li>
 				<li>If an artifact is dragged into a Text File the name of the artifact will be written inside the document.</li>
				<li>If an artifact is dragged into a relation in the Relational View of the Artifact Editor a new relation will be created with the source artifact and the target artifact in the editor.</li>
				<li>If an artifact is dragged within the Artifact Explorer the original Default Hierarchal Relation will be deleted and a new one be created whith the target artifact.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Dropping Onto The Artifact Explorer</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>If a file is dropped onto the Artifact Explorer a new artifact will be created with the contents of the source file and a new Default Hierarchal Relationship.</li>
			</ul>
