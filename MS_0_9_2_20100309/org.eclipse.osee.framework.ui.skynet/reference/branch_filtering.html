		<h1>Branch Filtering</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		A quick way to limit which branches are displayed in the Branch Manager view.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		Type text in to the box labeled <i>Filter:</i>. As characters are typed, the Branch Manager
		will update to only display branches whose name contains the text, ignoring the case.<br/>
		<br/>
		If no text is entered then all branches will be displayed.
