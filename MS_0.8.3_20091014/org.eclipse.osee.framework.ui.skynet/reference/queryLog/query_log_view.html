		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The Query Log view is used to review queries that have been run for the purpose of debugging. Details about the query
		such as how long it took to run, if any bind variables were passed, or if an SQL Exception was thrown while attempting to
		execute the query are all available. Run time is only reported for queries that executed successfully.</p>
		<p>Queries can be sorted by clicking on the column heading for the column to sort by. Initially, the data will be sorted in
		ascending order. Clicking the same column multiple times will toggle the sorting between ascending and descending. The table
		can be sorted on multiple columns by holding the CTRL key and selecting columns in the order which they should be sorted.</p>
		<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
