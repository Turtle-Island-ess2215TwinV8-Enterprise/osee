		<h1>Reordering Links</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		<p>A way to change the link ordering of a relation group. The results from link reordering will be reflected in the Relation Page and the Artifact Explorer.</p>

		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		<p>Relation links may be reordered within the same relation link group by selecting the link and dropping it into the desired location. Since the target indicator is displayed after the selected artifact pressing the ctrl key will shift the indicator to before the artifact, therefore allowing artifacts to be moved to the bottom of the link group.</p>
