		<h1>Creating a new Link</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		<p>Linking artifacts to each other.</p>

		<h2>How to do it</h2>
			<p>New relation links can be created one of two ways.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the relation link group desired exists on the artifact a new link may be created by dragging another artifact onto the relation link group. </li>
 				<li>If the relation group does not already exist a new relation group may be created by right clicking in the relation page then select “New Relation” and selecting the desired relation group. Only valid relation groups for the specific artifact will be enabling in the menu list. Menus where either artifact can be valid for either side will contain “…” after the text. When selected a dialog box will be displayed where the relation side of the source artifact will be placed.</li>
			</ul>
