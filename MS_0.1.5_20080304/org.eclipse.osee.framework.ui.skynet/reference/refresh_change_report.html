		<h1>Refresh Change Report</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Forces the Change Report to be recomputed. This is typically used when the Change Report snapshot has become out of date,
		noted by a <img src="../images/old.gif"/> next to the snapshot	description on the first line of the Change Report.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		Select the refresh button (<img src="../images/refresh.gif"/>) from the toolbar on the top portion of the Change Report view.<br/>
		<br/>
		If the Change Report view is empty then the refresh button will do nothing.
