<h1>OSEE Test Environment (OTE) Overview</h1>

<p>
OTE provides a framework for the testing of complex software systems.  The test environment manages models, messages, remote communication, and logging.     
</p>

<p>
Environments provide the core configuration of the tests, there is generally a 1 to 1 mapping between environments and labs.  Generally, tests are written which set input and check output against the unit under test.  These tests are sent to the Test Environment which then will coordinate with the unit under test to run the submitted test, or set the requested input.
