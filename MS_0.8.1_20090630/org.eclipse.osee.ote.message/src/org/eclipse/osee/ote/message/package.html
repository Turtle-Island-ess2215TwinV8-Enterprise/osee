<h1>Message System Test Environment</h1>

<p>
The Message System Test Environment is the base environment that provides message and element support.  This includes most of the element types such as Integer, Float, etc... and the checks that are available on both the message and the element.  It also adds in the remote message service which enables all of the messaging based tools that remote clients use.
