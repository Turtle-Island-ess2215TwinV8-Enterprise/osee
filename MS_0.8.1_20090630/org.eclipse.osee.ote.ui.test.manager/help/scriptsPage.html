		<h1>Test Manager Scripts Page</h1>
		<p>The Scripts page of Test Manager is the page that is the main 
		controller of running test scripts.&nbsp; Below is a screenshot of the 
		Script page with no scripts in it.&nbsp; There is a box near the bottom 
		that has information related to the running of the scripts.&nbsp; There 
		are also widgets along the top of the page that allow for saving and 
		loading of script run lists, clearing out of scripts highlighted, code 
		to run against selection, and a test server connection widget.&nbsp; The 
		running and aborting widgets are there as well, though they are grayed 
		out since the user is not connected to a test server yet.&nbsp;  
		</p>

		<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>Below, the user has put some test scripts in the 
		Script page.&nbsp; The check box to the left is for determining if the 
		script will be run when the play button (which is still grayed out).&nbsp; 
		The names of the test scripts are in the Test column.&nbsp; The Status 
		column shows the current status of the test script, and they all show 
		NOT_CONNECTED when the Test Manager is not connected to a test server.&nbsp; 
		The location of the test script is also shown.<p>

		In this shot, the Test Manager has now connected to a test server.&nbsp; 
		The status of the scripts is shown as READY, and the test server 
		connection widget is now shown as a lightning bolt.&nbsp; Also, notice 
		that the green play button is not grayed out anymore.&nbsp; It can be 
		selected to start the running of the selected test scripts.</p>

		<p>Below, the test script run is in progress.&nbsp; Notice the first 
		script is completed and there is a checkmark in the Output File column.&nbsp; 
		That signifies that an output file has been created for the completed 
		run.&nbsp; The user can double-click the checkmark to open the output 
		file.&nbsp; The results of the run are shown in the Result column, and 
		it even shows the results while in progress.&nbsp; The first script 
		passed all 721 test point.&nbsp; The 2nd script&nbsp; is still running 
		and has failed 1 of the 9 test points so far.</p>
