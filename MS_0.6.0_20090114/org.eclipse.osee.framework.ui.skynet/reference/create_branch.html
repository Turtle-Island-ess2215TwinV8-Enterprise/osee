		<h1>Default Branch</h1>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		The branch which is returned to any program that asks for the current default branch. For instance,
		the Artifact Explorer will use the default branch to determine what artifacts to show, and artifact
		searches are performed against the default branch.
		<h2>How to tell what the default branch is</h2>
		The Branch Manager view shows all of the branches with the <img src="../images/branch.gif"/> icon.<br/>
		<br/>
		The default branch will have a <img src="../images/black_check.gif"/> at the top right of the normal branch icon.<br/>
		<br/>
		Most views and editors that are working with artifacts will show the branch in the status bar next to the branch icon.
		<h2>How to set it</h2>
		The default branch is set from the Branch Manager view. Use sorting or filtering in the table to find the
		desired branch. Right-click on the branch and then select <i>Set Default Branch</i> from the popup menu.<br/>
		<br/>
		The <i>Set Default Branch</i> option will be disabled if any of the following cases are true:
		<ul>
		<li>The branch selected is already the default</li>
		<li>The item selected is not a branch</li>
		<li>More than one item is selected</li>
		</ul>
